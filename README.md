# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

## 📚 Project Overview
The **Movie Recommender System** is a machine learning-based application designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **cosine similarity**, the system analyzes movie metadata and suggests movies based on user preferences.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎥 **Content-Based Recommendations:** Suggests movies based on similarity of movie descriptions.
- 🧠 **NLP Techniques:** Utilizes text analysis for meaningful recommendations.
- 📊 **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the similarity between movie vectors.
- 💾 **Model Serialization:** Ensures seamless deployment with `Pickle`.
- 🌐 **Interactive Interface:** Deployed using **Streamlit** for real-time interaction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Word2Vec**
- **Cosine Similarity**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pickle**

## 📊 Dataset
- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**
- **TMDB 5000 Credits Dataset**

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/chetanp2002/Python.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd movie-recommender-system
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📝 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned and prepared for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Text data is processed using NLP techniques.
3. **Similarity Calculation:** Cosine similarity is applied to calculate the distance between movie vectors.
4. **Recommendation:** Based on user input, top 5 similar movies are recommended.

## 🌐 Deployment
The system is deployed using **Streamlit**, enabling an easy-to-use web interface.
